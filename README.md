## Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet crucial task for investors and traders. This project leverages the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to model and predict stock price movements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. It includes historical stock prices, volume, and other relevant information. Ensure to review and preprocess the dataset according to your specific requirements.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock_Market_analysis_using_LSTM.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Stock_Market_analysis_using_LSTM
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the Data:** Before training the model, preprocess the dataset using the provided preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model:** Train the LSTM model by running the following command:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_path path/to/new_data.csv
   ```

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model architecture is defined in the `model.py` file. Customize the architecture as needed for your specific use case.

## Training

Adjust the hyperparameters and training settings in the `config.yaml` file. Run the training script to train the model on your preprocessed data.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or other relevant metrics. The evaluation script is available in `evaluate_model.py`.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```
